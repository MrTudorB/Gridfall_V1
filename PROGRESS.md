## Completed Steps

### Step 0: Project Initialization ✅ COMPLETE
**Started:** 2025-01-18
**Completed:** 2025-01-18

**Completed Tasks:**
- ✅ Created monorepo folder structure
- ✅ Git repository initialized
- ✅ Created `.gitignore`
- ✅ Created `README.md`
- ✅ Created `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`
- ✅ Created `PROGRESS.md`
- ✅ Generated 10 test wallets
- ✅ Created shared types file (constants.ts, types.ts)
- ✅ First git commit (edae70d)

**Git Commit:** `edae70d` - "chore: initialize gridfall project structure"

### Step 1: Smart Contract Basic Structure ✅ COMPLETE
**Started:** 2025-01-18
**Completed:** 2025-01-18

**Completed Tasks:**
- ✅ Initialized Hardhat project in contracts folder
- ✅ Installed dependencies (Hardhat, OpenZeppelin, TypeScript)
- ✅ Created GridfallGame.sol with joinGame functionality
- ✅ Configured Hardhat for Arbitrum Sepolia
- ✅ Created deployment script
- ✅ Wrote comprehensive tests (14 tests, all passing)
- ✅ Successfully compiled contracts
- ✅ All tests passing with gas reporting

**Test Results:**
- ✅ 14/14 tests passing
- ✅ Join game functionality fully tested
- ✅ Gas optimization metrics generated
- ✅ Deployment gas: ~701,928

**Git Commit:** `c1b3356` - "feat(contracts): implement basic GridfallGame contract"

### Step 2: Smart Contract Game Flow ✅ COMPLETE
**Started:** 2025-01-18
**Completed:** 2025-01-18

**Completed Tasks:**
- ✅ Implemented `startGame()` function (admin only)
- ✅ Implemented `ping()` function with privacy (no events)
- ✅ Implemented `safeExit()` with 50% refund
- ✅ Implemented `endGame()` and `claimPrize()` functions
- ✅ Added mock iExec callback functions (_roleGenerationCallback, _pingCallback, _endGameCallback)
- ✅ Implemented protocol fee distribution (5% to owner)
- ✅ Wrote comprehensive test suite (45 tests)
- ✅ Full game simulation test passing

**Test Results:**
- ✅ 45/45 tests passing
- ✅ All game mechanics tested (join, start, ping, safe exit, end, claim)
- ✅ Protocol fee distribution verified
- ✅ Safe exit refund logic tested
- ✅ Edge cases covered (double claim, eliminated players, etc.)
- ✅ Full game flow simulation successful

**Key Features Implemented:**
- Start game requires 10 players
- Ping function keeps scanner identity private (no events)
- Safe exit provides 50% refund and marks player eliminated
- Protocol takes 5% fee on game end
- Winners split remaining 95% equally
- Claim prize with reentrancy protection

**Git Commit:** `cf05aa7` - "feat(contracts): implement complete game flow with mock iExec"

## Next Steps

1. Begin Step 2: Smart Contract Game Flow
2. Implement: startGame(), ping(), safeExit(), endGame(), claimPrize()
3. Add mock iExec callback functions
4. Write comprehensive tests for all game mechanics
5. Test protocol fee distribution (5%)

## Notes

- Project uses iExec Data Protector for role encryption
- Target: 10 players (2 Sentinels, 8 Echoes)
- Deployment target: Arbitrum Sepolia testnet
- Demo length: 3 minutes
- All tests passing with good gas optimization
