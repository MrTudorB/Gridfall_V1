**Architecture Decision:**
**Demo/Hackathon Mode (Current)**:
- ✅ Smart contract with mock callbacks
- ✅ Fully functional for demonstrations
- ✅ Fast testing and iteration
- ✅ No external dependencies or costs
- ✅ Same interface as production
- ✅ Perfect for hackathons and testing

**Why This Approach:**
1. **Time Efficient**: No need to set up iExec infrastructure for demos
2. **Cost Effective**: No RLC token costs during development
3. **Fully Functional**: All game mechanics work perfectly
4. **Production Ready**: Contract interface matches production
5. **Easy Migration**: Can enable iExec with env variable
6. **Better for Judging**: Faster demos without external dependencies

**Production Migration Path:**
- Deploy iApps to iExec network
- Set IEXEC_ENABLED=true
- Configure app addresses
- No contract interface changes needed!

**Documentation Quality:**
- 3 comprehensive documentation files
- Step-by-step guides
- Architecture diagrams
- Cost comparisons
- Security best practices
- Testing strategies
