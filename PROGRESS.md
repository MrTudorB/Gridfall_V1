- GameGrid: Disabled contract reads, uses simulation callbacks
- Results: Calculates winners from non-eliminated players
- Auto-simulation: Random 2-3 players scan after each user move
- Staggered timing (1s + 800ms per move) for realistic feel

**Benefits for Demos:**
- Judges can explore UI without wallet setup
- No dependency on contract owner to start games
- Instant understanding of game mechanics
- Works even as an Echo (other players make moves)
- Perfect for presentations and hackathon judging

### Step 12: E2E Testing Script and "How to Play" Modal ✅ COMPLETE
**Started:** 2025-10-19
**Completed:** 2025-10-19

**Completed Tasks:**

npx hardhat run scripts/e2e-test.ts --network arbitrumSepolia
```

**Expected Test Duration:** 2-5 minutes depending on network speed

**Gas Estimates:**
- Total test cost: ~0.02-0.03 ETH
- Join: ~50k-80k gas per player
- Start: ~100k-150k gas
- Ping: ~50k-100k gas each
- End: ~200k-300k gas
- Claim: ~40k-60k gas per winner
