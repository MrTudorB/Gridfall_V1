The docs were very well put together, job well done there.
You were by far the best documented sponsor at this event and you deserve congratulations!

The only thing I could have used some more of is RLC, but I guess I could have used lower prices for my game as well.
Anyway, it was a lot of fun building using your tech and I hope you enjoy playing my game as much as I enjoyed building it!
